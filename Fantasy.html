          <h2>My Recommendations</h2>
          <h3>"The Way of Kings" Brandon Sanderson</h3>
          <p>his story is an epic fantasy novel.  It follows the view points of several characters,
            including Dalinar Kholin, Highprince, whose brother was the king,
            who was recently murdered. This series is very indepth ,
            so best to read them back to back to better understand the plot going forward.</p>

            <p>This is the story of Achilles as told by Patroclus, his ward,
              and eventually Achilles's lover. See the incredible superhuman powers
